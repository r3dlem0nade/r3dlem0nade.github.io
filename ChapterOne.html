        <h2 id="ChapterOneStory"> Story </h2>
        <br>
        <p>This chapter begins with our main character Jimmy Hopkins being dropped off to his new
          school "Bullworth Academy" by his mother and his new stepfather. Once outside the school gates,
          Jimmy meets Miss Danvers and is told to meet the schools Principal Dr.Crabblesnitch. After Jimmy
          talks to Mr.Crabblesnitch, he meets Gary in the boys dorm. Gary offers to be friends with Jimmy, and
          later on Peter is introduced aswell. Jimmy spends a few months fighting off bullies and corrupt
          teachers/staff and builds reputation with the likes of the nerds. Eventaully Halloween comes background
          and Gary has an idea for a prank on some of the staff. After Halloween, Gary talks about how him
          and Jimmy are going to take over the school together, Gary eventually betrays Jimmy and that sets us up
          for chapter II</p> <br>

        <h3 id="ChapterOneGoals">Goals </h3><br>
        <p>When it comes to getting 100% Bully completion rate there is a couple
          Things to take into consideration:<br><br>
          Firstly, Non-Storyline Missions can be left behind until you reach chapter VI, The
          Endless Summer is as it suggests, <b>Endless</b>. This means anything that is left behind wether
          it be collectable items such as rubber bands or non-storyline missions can be done with no time limit
          to completion.
          <br><br>
          Next you also need to take into consideration the chapter I mission "The Big Prank" is a limited mission.
          It is the only one of its kind in the game and as said before every other non-storyline mission is completable
          in Chapter VI.<b> Make sure you do this mission the moment it becomes available!</b>
          <br><br>
          In chapter VI of this website, I will explain the different collecables you must get to achieve 100%, and I will also
          Explain the different side tasks required for completion. In saying that, if you wish to get pumkins and tombstones done,
          you can do so in chapter I. Further on this page their will be a youtube video showing all of the different locations
          these two collectables are.
